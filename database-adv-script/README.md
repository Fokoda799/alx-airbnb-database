# ALX Airbnb Database Project

## About the Project
This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, designed to provide hands-on experience with a simulated Airbnb database. Participants will implement **advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques**, tackling real-world challenges such as query performance, complex SQL scripts, and database scalability. By the end of this project, learners will be equipped to manage large-scale applications efficiently and effectively.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, learners will:

- **Master Advanced SQL**: Write complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations.  
- **Optimize Query Performance**: Analyze and refactor SQL scripts using tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.  
- **Implement Indexing and Partitioning**: Apply indexing and table partitioning to improve performance on large datasets.  
- **Monitor and Refine Performance**: Continuously assess database health and optimize schemas and queries.  
- **Think Like a DBA**: Make data-driven decisions for schema design and high-volume application optimization.

---

## Requirements
To succeed in this project, learners should have:

- A solid understanding of **SQL fundamentals** (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY).  
- Knowledge of **relational database concepts** such as primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization.  
- Basic familiarity with **performance monitoring tools** like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.  
- The ability to **set up and manage a GitHub repository** for project submission.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams
- Model relationships between **users, bookings, properties, and reviews** using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.

### 2. Complex Queries with Joins
- Practice **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN** to extract meaningful insights from multiple tables.

### 3. Power of Subqueries
- Use **correlated and non-correlated subqueries** for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filtering users by activity.

### 4. Aggregations and Window Functions
- Perform analytical operations using **COUNT, SUM**, and advanced window functions like **ROW_NUMBER** and **RANK**.

### 5. Indexing for Optimization
- Identify bottlenecks and create **indexes** on frequently queried columns to improve query execution times.

### 6. Query Optimization Techniques
- Write, analyze, and refactor queries to reduce redundancies and leverage indexing for faster performance.

### 7. Partitioning Large Tables
- Improve performance on large datasets by **partitioning the Booking table**, focusing on date-range queries and comparing pre/post partitioning results.

### 8. Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement
- Use `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and implement schema refinements.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive workflow to **write efficient SQL queries**, **analyze performance**, and **strategically design databases**. Learners will be well-prepared to tackle real-world database challenges in **high-performance, large-scale applications**.
